The script is designed to track a person's hands and a white keyboard and record the typing time based on the amount of time the person's hand stays on the keyboard.

Recommended to use Anaconda Navigator to run the script with Spyder. 

Import the Virtual Environment (ExperimentPyEnv.yaml) to Anaconda Navigator.

Open the script file (data_collection_typing_hand_tracking.py) with Spyder.

Change line #56 to the video recording file path. For real-time usage, uncomment line #59 and comment line #56.

Change the data file name in line #83 as desired.

Run the script.
